The survey can be carried out over: \n* Inbound Voice - the PureCloud agent will transfer the caller to the survey at the conclusion of the call\n* Outbound Voice - Survey Dynamix will call the caller in the future to conduct the survey\n* SMS - the caller will complete the survey via conversational SMS in the future\n* Web – the survey is completed on a web page\n* Email – the survey is presented in an email and the first question is answered from within the email and the remainder of the survey over a web page\n\nWhen creating a survey, PureCloud passes relevant business data to Survey Dynamix which allows Survey Dynamix to provide personalised and contextual survey prompts and context rich real-time reporting.\n\nThe Survey Dynamix dashboard is embedded as an “app” within the PureCloud interface. This provides users with easy access to the real-time reporting available on the dashboard from the PureCloud App view.\n\nSidebar widgets can be configured with any combination of the charts and tables available in the Survey Dynamix solution for easy access and continuous visibility of the metrics important to the PureCloud user.\n\n## Business Benefits\n\nHaving Survey Dynamix embedded in Purecloud means that users do not need to go far to keep an eye on the important feedback of their customers. Single sign-on means users are authenticated automatically and provided the views appropriate to their access levels – supervisors and managers can view the overall feedback for the centre while agents can keep an eye on the feedback specific to them.\nSurveying customers automatically is important to ensure feedback is received in a timely manner and providing the ability to survey customers across a variety of different channels means the most appropriate channel for the customer can be chosen to ensure the maximum amount of completed surveys is received."

The integration with Purecloud provides immediate notifications to users in Purecloud enabling them to investigate and respond immediately. This can be further automated through the use of Outbound Contact campaigns."

At scheduled intervals, the integration pulls historical data, which is specified in the connector configuration, from PureCloud. This historical data contains information about agent activities and calls, emails, and chats handled.\n\nThe integration performs calculations on this data. The integration can generate four types of reports using these calculations:\n\n - Agent Productivity Report: This report contains both information about agent activities and calls, emails, and chats handled by agents.\n\n - Call Statistics Report: This report contains information about calls handled based on queues.\n\n - Email Statistics Report: This report contains information about emails handled based on queues.\n\n - Chat Statistics Report:This report contains information about chats handled based on queues.\n\n After generating the reports, the integration sends them to a shared output directory for Verint to access."
